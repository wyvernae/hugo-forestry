                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Chicken N Chips is a Nashua classic located at 12 W. Hollis St. In 2009, Jim and Gina Udice,
                    co-owners of
                    Professor’s Pizza in Hudson, stepped in and saved the 50+ year-old fast-food mainstay. They have
                    owned
                    and
                    operated the chicken emporium ever since.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    “I always heard how this place was an institution, people love the food, and we just
                    wanted
                    to
                    carry on the tradition.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>After he and his wife bought Chicken N Chips, Udice remodeled the interior and exterior. </p>
                <p>He decided to get back to the basics, concentrating on providing “high, high quality” for the
                    restaurant’s
                    four
                    traditional staples: chicken stix, chicken on the bone, Jo-Jo potatoes, and onion rings.</p>

                <h1>What Makes Us Special</h1>
                <p>
                    Eat-in diners can appreciate the urban feel of the place with City Hall across the street and plenty
                    of
                    people-watching to do through the large windows. The restaurant has plenty of tables, is clean and
                    cheerful,
                    and
                    guests love the chicken-o-bilia displayed in a curio case we call “The Chicken Coop,” including the
                    original
                    yellow and green Chicken N Chips sign. </p>
                <p>We have a big menu, with a hamburger and some seafood included, but for the most part, we are about
                    chicken,
                    chicken and more chicken!</p>
                <p>“Many of the customers comment they thought we were ordering small portions, but Chicken N Chips has
                    a
                    very
                    generous definitions of a “small” serving,” explained Udice.<blockquote>“Nothing is pre-made,
                        everything is
                        cooked
                        to
                        order, so we remind guests it may take 5 – 10 minutes for food to cook.”
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>Hands down, our customers’ favorite is the Chicken Stix, which are basically upscale chicken tenders,
                    which
                    are
                    fresh, breaded, hand-trimmed chicken breast tenderloins. The outside is crispy, the inside is juicy,
                    and
                    they
                    are bursting with flavor. Various sides / sauces are available to add some adventure.</p>

                <h1>Come try our Chicken!</h1>
                <p>With chicken leading the menu, you’d expect nicely seasoned chicken wings – and that’s what you’ll
                    get!
                    Another
                    menu leader is the Chicken Kabob Wrap, with big chunks of charbroiled chicken breast, feta cheese,
                    lettuce,
                    and
                    tomato with Greek dressing.</p>
                <p> Typical appetizers include mozzarella sticks and onion rings, which are thin-cut and crispy. </p>
                <p>The winning sides tend to be our homemade coleslaw and the Jo-Jos, which are wedge-cut potatoes
                    battered
                    and
                    fried to perfection.</p>
                <p>
                    <blockquote>“We do specialize in chicken, and feel we have the best chicken meals in Nashua,”
                    </blockquote> said Udice. And
                    from
                    the
                    continuous stream of guests coming in ordering, Nashuans seem to agree.
                </p>
